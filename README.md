# Easy DOM
It is a simple version of DOM I wrote for reviewing different APIs of DOM.

Also, I provide views of examples for most parts of the APIs I used on the page.

Feel free to modify them if you want.

## How to use
```
yarn global add parcel
```

or
```
npm i -g parcel
```

then
```
parcel src/index.html
```
